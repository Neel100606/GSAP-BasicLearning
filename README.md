ðŸŽ¬ GSAP Basics - Learning Animation
Welcome to my GSAP Basics Repository!
This repo contains the foundational projects and exercises I built while learning GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP). It covers essential animation techniques in JavaScript and how GSAP makes it easier and more efficient to create smooth, interactive animations.

ðŸ§  What I Learned
Throughout this project, I learned the following GSAP animation techniques and concepts:

âœ… Key Concepts:
1. JS Animation
   Created basic animations directly using JavaScript, understanding how to manipulate the DOM and apply dynamic styles to elements.

2. Tween
   Learned how to use GSAP's Tween class to animate elements between specific values (such as position, opacity, or scale).

3. Set Method
   Explored the set() method in GSAP, allowing me to instantly apply styles or set up initial states for elements without animation.

4. from() and fromTo() Methods
   Learned how to use the from() and fromTo() methods to animate elements from specific properties or from one state to another, offering flexibility in animation direction.

5. Staggers
   Implemented staggered animations, where multiple elements animate sequentially, with a small delay between each. Great for animating lists or grids of items.

6. Controlling Tweens
   Gained knowledge of how to control tweens, including pausing, reversing, and adjusting playback speed, giving more control over the animations.

7. Timelines
   Explored GSAP's Timeline feature to create synchronized sequences of animations, allowing for the execution of multiple animations in a specific order.

8. Simple Project
   Built a simple project that applied the basic GSAP techniques I learned, showcasing the power and ease of using GSAP for creating animations.
